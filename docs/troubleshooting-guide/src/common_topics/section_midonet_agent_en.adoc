== Debugging

During troubleshooting periods, you can increase the logging level via the
`mn-conf` utility.

The available log levels are: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`

To check the currently configured level, execute the following command on an
Agent host:

[literal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
$ mn-conf get agent.loggers.root
agent.loggers.root = *INFO*
----

To increase the log level to `DEBUG`, execute the following command:

[literal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
$ echo "agent.loggers.root : *DEBUG*" | mn-conf set
----

This change does not require an Agent restart.
