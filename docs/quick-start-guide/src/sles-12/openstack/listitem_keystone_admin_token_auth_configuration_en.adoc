. *Verify Admin Token Authentication*
+
====
The MidoNet API uses the Keystone admin token for authentication purposes,
therefore *`admin_token_auth`* has to be kept in the corresponding Keystone
pipeline configuration sections.

Ensure that *`admin_token_auth`* is included in the following pipelines in
`/usr/share/keystone/keystone-dist-paste.ini`:

[literal,subs="quotes"]

[pipeline:public_api]
pipeline = [...] admin_token_auth [...]

[pipeline:admin_api]
pipeline = [...] admin_token_auth [...]

[pipeline:api_v3]
pipeline = [...] admin_token_auth [...]
