This guide assumes the following example system architecture.

OpenStack Controller Node:

* Controller Node (*_controller_*)

Compute Node:

* Compute Node (*_compute1_*)

Since MidoNet is a distributed system, it does not have the concept of a Network
Node as being used with the default OpenStack networking plugin. Instead it uses
two or more Gateway Nodes that utilize http://www.quagga.net/[Quagga] to provide
connectivity to external networks via the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).

* Gateway Node 1 (*_gateway1_*)
* Gateway Node 2 (*_gateway2_*)

Three or more hosts are being used for the MidoNet Network State Database (NSDB)
cluster which utilizes https://zookeeper.apache.org/[ZooKeeper] and
http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/gettingStartedCassandraIntro.html[Cassandra]
to store virtual network topology and connection state information:

* NSDB Node 1 (*_nsdb1_*)
* NSDB Node 2 (*_nsdb2_*)
* NSDB Node 3 (*_nsdb3_*)

The _MidoNet Agent (Midolman)_ has to be installed on all nodes where traffic
enters or leaves the virtual topology. In this guide this are the
*_controller_*, *_gateway1_*, *_gateway2_* and *_compute1_* hosts.

The _Midonet API_ can be installed on a separate host, but this guide assumes it
to be installed on the *_controller_* host.

The _Midonet Command Line Interface (CLI)_ can be installed on any host that has
connectivity to the MidoNet API. This guide assumes it to be installed on the
*_controller_* host.

The _Midonet Neutron Plugin_ replaces the ML2 Plugin and has to be installed on
the *_controller_*, *_gateway1_*, *_gateway2_* and *_compute1_* hosts.
