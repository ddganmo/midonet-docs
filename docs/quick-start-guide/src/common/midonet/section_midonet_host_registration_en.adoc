. *Create tunnel zone*

MidoNet supports the Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) and Virtual Extensible
LAN (VXLAN) protocols to communicate to other hosts within a tunnel zone.
+
To use the GRE protocol, create the tunnel zone with type 'gre':
+
====

midonet> tunnel-zone create name tz type gre

To use the VXLAN protocol, create the tunnel zone with type 'vxlan':
+
====
[source]
----
midonet> tunnel-zone create name tz type vxlan
tzone0
