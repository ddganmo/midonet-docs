. *Verify ZooKeeper Operation*
+
After installation of all nodes has been completed, verify that ZooKeeper is
operating properly.

A basic check can be done by executing the `ruok` (Are you ok?) command on all
nodes. This will reply with `imok` (I am ok.) if the server is running in a
non-error state:
