= SELinux Configuration

[IMPORTANT]
This guide assumes that SELinux (if installed) is either in `permissive` state
or `disabled`.

To change the mode, execute the following command:

[source]
----
# setenforce Permissive
----

To permanently change the SELinux configuration, edit the `/etc/selinux/config`
file accordingly:

[source]
----
SELINUX=permissive
----
