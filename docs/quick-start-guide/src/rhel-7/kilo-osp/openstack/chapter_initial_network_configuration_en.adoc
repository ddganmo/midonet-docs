====
Use the following command to create the external network:

$ neutron net-create ext-net --router:external

[NOTE]
MidoNet will automatically create the `MidoNet Provider Router` when you create
an external network in OpenStack. This is an internal router in MidoNet that
acts as the gateway router of the cloud. There is always only one Provider
Router, even if there are multiple external networks.
