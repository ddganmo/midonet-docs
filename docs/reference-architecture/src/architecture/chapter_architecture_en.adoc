= MidoNet network architecture

MidoNet operates an overlay network on top of an existing physical network.
MidoNet Agents run in software on the edge of the network in both the GW
(gateway) nodes, as well as on the compute hosts.

In addition to the MidoNet Agents, there is also a state-management system,
which coordinates with each of the distributed agents. For centralized
management, MidoNet also provides a RESTful API server.
