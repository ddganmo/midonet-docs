= Virtual routers
A virtual router is an abstraction of a physical layer 3 (L3) router and is
MidoNet's L3 forwarding element.

Like a physical router, on a virtual router, you can configure network
interfaces (ports), network up-links (also ports, but ports that are bound to
physical Ethernet interfaces that connect to upstream devices, typically
physical routers and bridges). You can connect virtual routers to other routers
and bridges.
