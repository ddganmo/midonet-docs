[[internal_network]]
= Internal and underlay network

MidoNet relies on IP reach-ability between all servers.

We therefore recommend an IP network using non-global IP addresses (see
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918[RFC 1918]). In a very small deployment of one
rack or less, a single Ethernet switch could serve as the internal network,
albeit representing a single point of failure. For larger deployments, a
hierarchical IP-routed network, possibly with equal cost multi-path (ECMP),
would be appropriate.
