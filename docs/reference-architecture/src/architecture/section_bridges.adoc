= Bridges

Bridges are MidoNet's L2 forwarding elements.

You can create virtual ports on bridges. In turn, you can attach VMs to virtual
ports on a bridge. All VMs attached to the same bridge are reachable through L2
connectivity. You can connect ports on virtual bridges to another virtual device
or a physical machine.

Bridges store the mappings between MAC addresses of network devices that send
received frames and the bridge ports they receive them from.

The bridge dynamically builds a table of the source MAC addresses and the bridge
ports. The bridge uses this table to send frames destined for the network device
to the correct bridge port. You can clear the MAC table.
