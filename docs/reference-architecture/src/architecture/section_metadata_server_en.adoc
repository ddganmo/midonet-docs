= Metadata server

The metadata server is used for storing instance VM configuration information,
for example, authentication information or a VM customization script.

In an OpenStack environment, the metadata is stored in Nova Metadata API.
MidoNet provides a Metadata Proxy implementation, which forwards metadata
requests from VMs to the Nova Metadata API, in a similar way Neutron Metadata
Proxy does.
