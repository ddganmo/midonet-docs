= Metadata server

The metadata server is used for storing instance VM configuration information,
for example, authentication information or a VM customization script.

In an OpenStack environment, the metadata is stored in Nova Metadata API.
MidoNet provides a Metadata Proxy implementation, which forwards metadata
requests from VMs to the Nova Metadata API, in a similar way Neutron Metadata
Proxy does.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Metadata Proxy creates an interface on the hypervisor hosts, named
"metadata".

When using `iptables` it may be necessary to add a rule to accept traffic on
that interface:

[source]
iptables -I INPUT 1 -i metadata -j ACCEPT
