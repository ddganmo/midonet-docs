A MidoNet Network State Database is a cluster of servers that stores MidoNet
configuration, run-time state, and statistics data.

MidoNet stores configuration-state information in two different systems. MidoNet
uses Apache™ Zookeeper™ and Cassandra™ for coordinating the operation between
MidoNet Agents, as well as storing the network configuration and state (Network
State Database nodes).

You should configure dedicated servers in this cluster to run the MidoNet
Network State Database and the servers should not host other software. Midokura
recommends that you dedicate three servers to this role.
