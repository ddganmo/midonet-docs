= Neutron BGP (Dynamic Routing)

MidoNetâ€™s implementation of Neutron BGP provides two different ways of
configuring BGP.

*Router Insertion*

In this mode, when you create a BGP speaker object, you specify the router to
which you want to associate it to. This does not match Neutron's
http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/neutron-specs/specs/mitaka/bgp-dynamic-routing.html[Dynamic Advertising Routes for Public Ranges]
specification, but matches MidoNet's BGP configuration more closely where you
configure BGP on a router. This feature is implemented as a Neutron vendor
extension, `bgp-speaker-router-insertion`. Router association is specified on
creation, and cannot be updated. You can choose to use this extension on BGP
Speaker basis.

In this mode, `add_gateway_network` and `delete_gateway_network` APIs are not
applicable. Calling these APIs will result in an error.

*Non Router Insertion*

In this mode, when you create a BGP speaker object, you do not specify a router
to associate with. This matches the expected behavior of the reference
implementation API. Even in this mode, however, a router must be associated with
the BGP speaker implicitly for MidoNet to be able to provide the BGP service.
The router association occurs when the `add_gateway_network` API is called on a
BGP speaker. In this operation, the specified network is always an external
network. If there is an edge router attached to the external network as its
gateway router, then this router is chosen to associate with the BGP speaker.
The `delete_gateway_network` API is used to disassociate a router from a BGP
speaker in this mode. If the specified external network does not have any edge
router as its gateway router, an error is thrown.

It is implied in both cases that with MidoNet a BGP speaker is always only
associated with one router. Hence, a BGP peer cannot be associated with multiple
BGP speakers. While this restriction deviates from the reference implementation
of BGP in Neutron, it closely matches the MidoNet implementation of BGP while
maintaining compatibility with the Neutron API. Note, however, that several BGP
peers can be associated with the same BGP speaker. MidoNet uses routing to
decide via which router interface/port to forward packets for a specific BGP
session.

Also, with MidoNet, all the networks attached to the router that have BGP
configured via router interface command will be advertised automatically. It
does not advertise gateway networks, and it does not advertise individual /32
Floating IP routes. Thus, the fields `advertise_floating_ip_host_routes` and
`advertise_tenant_networks` of BGP Speaker are ignored. Also, extra routes added
on the router are automatically advertised.

== Creating a router, network and subnet

In this example, we have an edge router (router acting as the gateway on an
external network) but the same workflow applies to regular tenant routers as
well.

Skip this step if you already created the Edge Router and external network and
subnets. This is here just for completeness.

== Updating a BGP Speaker

Only `name` can be updated.

== Adding a gateway network to a BGP speaker

If the BGP speaker is already associated with a router, an error is thrown. If
the external network specified in the request does not have any edge router
attached as its gateway router, an error is thrown. Otherwise, the edge router
is chosen and associated with the BGP Speaker. Once associated, it cannot be
associated to any other BGP speaker.
