= Improving Tomcat startup time

In some situations it may take Tomcat some time before it is ready to serve,
sometimes even up to 10 minutes.

This is very likely to happen when your Midonet API is deployed on Ubuntu 14.04
with Tomcat 7. A good way to improve Tomcat startup time is to set this in the
/usr/share/tomcat7/bin/catalina.sh file:

[source]
JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom"
