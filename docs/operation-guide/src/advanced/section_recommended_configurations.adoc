== Overview of Performance-Impacting Configuration Options

*midolman.conf*

*[midolman]*

simulation_threads - Number of threads to dedicate to packet processing

output_channels - Number of output channels to use for flow creation and packet
execution. Each channel gets a dedicated thread.

input_channel_threading - The MidoNet Agent creates dedicated Netlink channels
to receive packets from each datapath port. This option tunes the threading
strategy for reading on those channels: one_to_many will make the Agent use a
single thread for all input channels. one_to_one will make the Agent use one
thread for each input channel.

*[datapath]*

global_incoming_burst_capacity - Incoming packets are rate-limited by a
Hierarchical Token Bucket (HTB) that gets refilled as packets are processed and
exit the system. This setting controls the size in packets of the root bucket in
the HTB. It is the number of packets that the daemon will accept in a burst (at
a higher rate that it can handle) before it starts dropping packets. It's also
the maximum number of in-flight packets in the system. Changes to this value
affect latency at high-throughput rates.

tunnel_incoming_burst_capacity - Tunnel ports get their own bucket in the HTB,
allowing them to accumulate burst capacity if they are not sending at the max.
rate. This setting controls the size in packets of that bucket.

vm_incoming_burst_capacity - Each VM port gets its own bucket in the HTB,
allowing the ports to accumulate burst capacity if they are not sending at the
max. rate. This setting controls the size in packets of that bucket.

*midolman-akka.conf*

*akka*

loglevel - Log level for messages generated in certain parts of the Agent, such
as the packet-simulation code. The DEBUG setting is meant for development and
troubleshooting only because it severely affects performance and is highly
verbose.

*akka.actor.default-dispatcher*

parallelism-max - Number of threads to dedicate to non-fastpath, but potentially
expensive Agent components, such as flow management.

*midolman-env.sh*

MAX_HEAP_SIZE - Total amount of memory to allocate for the JVM.

HEAP_NEWSIZE - The total amount of the JVM memory that will be dedicated to the
Eden garbage-collection generation. 75% of the total is a good ballpark figure,
as the Agent uses most of the memory for short-lived objects during packet
processing.

*logback.xml*

*root*

level - Default process-wide log level. The DEBUG setting is meant for
development and troubleshooting only because it severely affects performance and
is highly verbose.
