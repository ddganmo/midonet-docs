= Cassandra cache

This section describes details relative to the Cassandra-based implementation of
the Cassandra cache used for connection tracking and NAT mappings.

*Client library and normal operation*

Cassandra operations are now asynchronous, so losing connectivity to Cassandra
should not impact simulations.

The loss of connectivity to a majority of nodes creates a risk that connections
will break on vport migration or MidoNet restart. But this is a low risk if the
operator can avoid vport migrations and MidoNet Agent restarts until Cassandra
is returned to normal operation.

To summarize, MidoNet can function with Cassandra down (but vport migrations and
agent restarts may break connections) so it should only be tolerated for very
brief periods.
