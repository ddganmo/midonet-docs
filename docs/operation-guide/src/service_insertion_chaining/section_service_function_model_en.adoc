= Service Function Model

The L2Insertion assumes a Service Function has:

* an addressable management interface (not managed or referenced from
  L2Insertion)
** Assign a Floating IP to allow access from outside the cloud.

* an unnumbered inspection interface
** receives the traffic of inspected VMs
** MidoNet can add a VLAN tag to signal policy, and PCP bits indicate direction
   (in-to/out-of VM)

Note that MidoNet drops all non-insertion traffic on an inspection port of a
network function.
