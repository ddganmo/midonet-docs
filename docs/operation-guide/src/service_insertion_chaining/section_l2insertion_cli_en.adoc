[[l2insertion_cli]]
= L2Insertion in MidoNet CLI

The following example inserts two service functions (located on Bridge1's port0
and port1) at Bridge0's port0. Only traffic to/from MAC fa:16:3e:a4:dd:58 is
protected. Different VLANs are used for the different service functions - this
is not required by MidoNet, the example assumes that the VM is protected by
different policies (or policies represented by different VLAN tag values) in the
different service functions.
