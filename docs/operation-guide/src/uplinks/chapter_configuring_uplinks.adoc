= Configuring uplinks

This section describes how to configure uplinks from a MidoNet-enabled cloud to
an external network.

The basic steps for configuring uplinks are:

. Connect a virtual port to an exterior port. 

. Set up a router. This includes configuring the routes for the traffic between
networks.

. Configure dynamic routing to allow for the exchange of routes between your
local autonomous system (AS) and other autonomous systems. MidoNet supports BGP,
which is an exterior routing protocol that allows MidoNet to advertize routes,
such as the route to the network associated with floating IPs, and receive
routes and reachability information from BGP peers.
