[[bgp_failover]]
= BGP failover configuration on a BGP peer

The default BGP failover time is 2-3 minutes. However, you can reduce this time
by changing some parameters on both ends of the session.

You must make the change in the midolman.conf file on the MidoNet side, and the
bgpd.conf file on the BGP peer's side. The example below shows how to use the
CLI to reduce the BGP fail-over time on a peer to one minute:

[source]
neighbor 10.1.0.1 timers 1 3
neighbor 10.1.0.1 timers connect 1
neighbor 10.1.0.2 timers 1 3
neighbor 10.2.0.1 timers connect 1

This sets the following values: bgp_connect_retry=1, bgp_holdtime=3, and
bgp_keepalive=1. These settings in the in the peer's bgpd.conf file must match
those on the other end of the BGP session.
