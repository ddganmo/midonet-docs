= Static Setup

If you are not connecting through a BGP link, or you just want to use static
routing follow this section.

This creates a static up-link to connect VMs to the external network.


. Enable IP forwarding
+
[source]
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

. Create a port on the Edge Router and bind it to the veth:
+
[source]
----
$ midonet-cli
midonet> router list
router router0 name Edge Router state up
midonet> router router0 add port addresses <Binding_Interface_CIDR>
router0:port0
midonet> router router0 add route src 0.0.0.0/0 dst 0.0.0.0/0 type normal port router router0 port port0 gw <Gw_Ip_On_Binding_Interface>
midonet> host list
host host0 name controller alive true
midonet> host host0 add binding port router router0 port port0 interface <Binding_Interface>
host host0 interface <Binding_Interface> port router0:port
----

Now we can reach VMs from the underlay host using their floating IPs, and VMs
can reach external networks as well (as long as the host has external
connectivity).
