= BGP Setup

You set up a BGP link to connect MidoNet with an external Autonomous System
(AS). This creates an up-link to an external network.

Typically, you connect a MidoNet network to the Internet through two independent
up-link routers. In the simple case of connecting MidoNet to the Internet via
two BGP-enabled routers, it's best to create two ports on the virtual router and
bind them to network interfaces in two different hosts (two Gateway Nodes). This
will distribute load between both Gateway Nodes hosts, as well as eliminate a
single point of failure. The two ports must be configured as a stateful port
pair, for details, refer to xref:stateful_port_groups[].

MidoNet uses quaggaâ€˜s bgpd to terminate BGP sessions on behalf of a virtual
router. The routes that bgpd learns from its peers are added to the virtual
router in MidoNet's topology. The quagga package is provided in the MidoNet
release package repositories. Any system running Midolman should already have
everything that it needs to set up the BGP. You have to keep in mind that bgpd
processes run in the host where a particular virtual router port is bound.

[IMPORTANT]
Make sure you have the following information before setting up the BGP:
Local and peer Autonomous System (AS) Numbers for the BGP session.
The IP address of the BGP peer.
