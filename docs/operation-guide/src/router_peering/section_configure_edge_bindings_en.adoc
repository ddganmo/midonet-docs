= Configure Edge Bindings

At this point, two tenant routers should be peered over VXLAN. To actually get
the traffic in and out, there must be an edge router with its ports bound to the
physical interfaces. Configuration of these edge bindings is out of this
document's scope, but there are several options to consider:

* Use the existing edge router that is serving north-south (Internet) traffic.
In this case, just link the VTEP router to the edge router.

* Use a dedicated edge router to handle VTEP traffic. In this case, create a new
edge router, configure its uplinks and connect the VTEP router to this edge
router.

* Use the VTEP router as an edge router. This is the most straightforward setup,
where you treat the VTEP router as an edge router and configure uplinks on its
ports directly.
