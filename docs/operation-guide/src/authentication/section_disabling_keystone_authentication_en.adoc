= Disabling Keystone authentication

MidoNet lets you disable authentication by using a mock authentication service.

Using this service has the effect that no outside authentication service is
used. Instead, MidoNet will return fake tokens to the authenticating clients.
Likewise, the provider will ignore any tokens sent by the client when
authorizing an API request.

To use the mock authentication service, you must configure the following
keys in the MidoNet configuration.
