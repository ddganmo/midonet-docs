[[clie_remove_vtep]]
= Removing a VTEP

Use this command to remove a VTEP.

*Syntax*

[source]
vtep management-ip vtep-ip-address remove

*Result*

Issuing this command completely removes a VTEP from the MidoNet's list of known
VTEPs.

The command will fail if any of the VTEP's port-VLAN pairs are bound to any
Neutron networks.

[NOTE]
Alternatively, you can delete a vxlan port to disassociate all VTEP's port-VLAN
pairs from a Neutron network.
