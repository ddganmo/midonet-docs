= Troubleshooting VTEP/VXGW configuration

You can use this information for troubleshooting the VXGW/VTEP:

* Try to establish a Telnet connection to the VTEP management interface IP and
port. You should be able to connect successfully if the VTEP has been properly
configured.

* You can examine the MAC-table of the Neutron network. MAC entries pointing to
vxlan ports indicate MAC addresses that are "local" to the vxlan port's VTEP.

* You can examine the ARP-suppression-table of the Neutron network. IP-mac
entries in that table (if they point to MACs that are local to MidoNet) are used
to populate MAC suppression tables in the VTEP.
