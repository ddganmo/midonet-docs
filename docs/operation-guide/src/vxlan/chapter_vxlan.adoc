MidoNet supports the Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) technology.

*What is VXLAN?*

VXLAN is a network virtualization technology that uses a VLAN-like encapsulation
technique to encapsulate MAC-based OSI layer 2 Ethernet frames within layer 3
UDP packets.

This type of encapsulation (Ethernet-in-IP) is much better suited to Software
Defined Networks than either VLANs (802.1q) or even stacked VLANs (Q-in-Q).

Another important advantage of VXLAN over traditional VLAN is its 24-bit VXLAN
ID thanks to which VXLAN can scale up to over 16 million logical networks. By
comparison - the maximum number of VLANs is 4096.

*How is VXLAN supported in MidoNet?*

MidoNet provides VXLAN implementation through:

* VXLAN Gateway, to bridge the overlay with physical L3 hosts in the underlay.

* VXLAN tunneling between MidoNet hosts.
