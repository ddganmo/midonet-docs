You can create routers to provide L3 connectivity on a virtual network.

To create a router:

. Enter the following command to list the routers on the current tenant:
+
[source]
midonet> list router
midonet>
+
The above example shows no routers on the current tenant.

. Enter the command to create a new router and assign it a name:
+
[source]
midonet> router create name test-router
router1
+
The above command example shows how to create a new router named "test-router".
The output shows the alias "router1" assigned to the new router.
