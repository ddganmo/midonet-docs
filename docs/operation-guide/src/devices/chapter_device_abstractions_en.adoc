The major resources in MidoNet's virtual network model are routers, bridges,
ports, load balancers, VTEPs, chains, and rules.

Routers, bridges, and ports are devices that comprise a virtual network topology
and chains and rules are policies applied to the network elements.

MidoNet lets you create routers and bridges.
