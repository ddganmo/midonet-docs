= Adding a port to a router

You need to add a port to a router to connect the router to a bridge (network)
or another router.

[NOTE]
When using the MidoNet CLI, if necessary, use the sett command or some other
means to access the desired tenant.

. Enter the command to add a port to the desired router and specify the desired
IPÂ address and network for the port:
+
[source]
midonet> router router1 add port addresses 10.100.1.1/24
router1:port0
+
The above output shows the alias ("port0") assigned to the new port.

. Enter the command to list port information for the router:
+
[source]
midonet> router router1 list port
port port0 device router1 state up mac 02:a6:81:08:ab:5d addresses 10.100.1.1/24
+
The above output shows the:

* Alias assigned to the port ("port0")
* Device the port is attached to (router1)
* Port's state (up)
* Port's MAC address
* Port's IP and network prefix length
