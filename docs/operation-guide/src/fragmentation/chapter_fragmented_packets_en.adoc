= Handling fragmented packets

If you observe that MidoNet is encountering fragmented packets, this section
describes how you can handle this situation.

You can configure IP fragment matching in rules to configure how fragmented
packets are handled when L4 rules are applied in the virtual topology. This
feature allows IP fragments to pass through the virtual topology instead of
being dropped. With this feature implementation, you have the following options:

* If you are writing an L2/L3 firewall, you can be IP fragment agnostic: no
special handling of IP fragments is required. (L3 NAT handles IP fragments
correctly.)

* If you are writing an L4 firewall, you can specify special handling for IP
fragments.

== Definitions and allowed values

* header = the Condition matches non-fragmented packets AND header fragments.
header refers to a non-fragmented packet or to the first fragment (the header
fragment) of a fragmented packet. The header fragment is the only one whose IPv4
"fragment offset" field is set to zero. header is the only allowed value if the
rule's Condition matches L4 fields OR the rule is dynamic (that is, port
modifying) DNAT or SNAT

* nonheader = the Condition matches only non-header fragments. nonheader refers
to the second and subsequent fragments.

* any = the Condition matches any fragment AND non-fragmented packets.

* unfragmented = the Condition matches any non-fragmented packet.

[NOTE]
If the fragment-policy argument is not set, then it is treated like the setting
is any, unless header is the only allowed value.

[NOTE]
====
When you run OpenStack Icehouse against MidoNet with the Condition semantics
described above, the handling of fragments will change as follows:

Instead of dropping fragments when they pass through L4 rules, these fragments
will be ignored by L4 rules, and therefore, may potentially allow the packets
through filters.

A single L4 flow may generate up to two different flows: one to handle
non-header fragments, another to handle all other packets.

== Fragmented packets rule chain creation example

Create a chain (this creates a rule chain with an alias, "chain0" in the
example, pointing to the chain created):

[source]
create chain name chain0

Add a rule to the chain that drops header fragments:

[source]
chain chain0 add rule fragment-policy header pos 2 header type drop

*Example 1 Firewall, Does Not Account for Fragmented Packets*

The example below only handles non-fragmented packets. These are the firewall
rules you start with before you decide to handle fragmented packets.

Initially, you design your firewall to:

* Only allow incoming TCP port 80 (HTTP) traffic
* Drop all other packets

Without addressing fragmented packets, you create a rule chain with the
following two rules:

* Rule at position 1
+
** By default, this rule matches only non-fragmented packets and header
fragments.
+
** ACCEPTs packets with protocol=TCP and destination=80.
+
[source]
midonet> chain chain0 add rule ethertype 2048 src 0.0.0.0/0 proto 6 in-ports router2:port0 dst-port 80 pos 1 type accept

* Rule at position 2
+
** DROPs all packets.
+
[source]
midonet> chain chain0 add rule ethertype 2048 src 0.0.0.0/0 dst 0.0.0.0/0 in-ports router2:port0 pos 2 type drop

[source]
midonet> chain chain0 list rule
rule rule0 ethertype 2048 src 0.0.0.0/0 proto 6 tos 0 dst-port 80 in-ports router2:port0 pos 1 type accept
rule rule1 ethertype 2048 src 0.0.0.0/0 dst 0.0.0.0/0 proto 0 tos 0 in-ports router2:port0 pos 2 type drop

With the above rule chain, MidoNet handles fragmented packet with the
destination TCP port 80 as follows:

* The first half of the packet, which contains the TCP header, reaches the rule
at position 1, and is accepted.

* However, the second half of the fragmented, which does not have the
destination port, reaches the rule at position 1, does not match the rule's
condition, and is dropped. This means the fragmented packets do not reach the
Web server.

*Example 2 Firewall, Addresses Fragmented Packets*

To address this problem, MidoNet provides a mechanism to handle the fragmented
packets. This mechanism allows the fragmented packets to reach their
destination, as shown in the following example. The drawing below simply depicts
a whole, non-fragmented packet and a fragmented packet that consists of two
parts, a header and non-header.

== Non-Fragmented and Fragmented Packets

For this example, consider the following packets:

* Non-fragmented packet with the destination, TCP port 80

* Fragmented packet with the destination, TCP port 80

* Non-fragmented packet with the destination, TCP port 72

* Fragmented packet with the destination, TCP port 72

image::packet_fragments_multiple_ports.png[]

== Fragmented and Non-Fragmented Packets with Different Destinations

Given the above packets and the rule in example 1, MidoNet processes the packets
as follows:

* Packet 1 matches the rule in position 1 and is accepted.

* The header part of packet 2 matches the rule in position 1 and is accepted;
the non-header fragment, which doesn't contain the destination, does not match
the rule and is dropped.

* Packet 3's destination does not match the rule in position 1 and is dropped,
same thing for the header part of packet 4. The non-header part of packet 4 does
not contain destination information and is dropped.

The first objective is to accept the part of the packet fragments that contains
the headers. To do this, you create the same rule at position 1. The change is
to add a new rule at position 2, to drop all packets that contain TCP/UDP headers.

* Rule at position 1
+
** By default, this rule matches only non-fragmented packets and header
fragments.
+
** ACCEPTs packets from in-ports=router2:port0 with protocol=TCP and
destination=80.
+
[source]
midonet> chain chain18 add rule ethertype 2048 src 0.0.0.0/0 proto 6 in-ports router2:port0 dst-port 80 pos 1 type accept

* Rule at position 2
+
** Drop packets that contain TCP/UDP headers
+
[source]
midonet> chain chain18 add rule ethertype 2048 src 0.0.0.0/0 in-ports router2:port0 fragment-policy header pos 2 type drop

* Rule at position 3
+
** Accept all other packets
+
[source]
midonet> chain chain18 add rule ethertype 2048 src 0.0.0.0/0 in-ports router2:port0 dst 0.0.0.0/0 pos 3 type accept

Look at the packets in the above figure, starting with the packets destined for
port 72, and how they the progress through this new rule chain:

* Packet 3's destination is port 72, not port 80, does not match the rule in
position number 1, and continues to the rule at position number 2.

* Packet 3 contains a TCP header and therefore matches the rule at position
number 2 and isdropped.

* The header fragment of packet 4 contains a destination of port 72, does not
match the rule at position 1 and continues to the rule at position number 2.

* This fragment contains a TCP header, matches the rule at position number 2,
and is dropped.

* The non-header fragment of packet 4 does not contain a header (and therefore,
has no destination information), does not match the rule at position 1, and
continues to the rule at position 2.

* This non-header packet fragment does not contain a TCP/UDP header, does not
match the rule at position 2, and continues to the rule at position 3.

* The rule at position 3 accepts all packets that reach it and accepts this
packet fragment. Because this packet does not have any associated header
information it will not be reassembled and sent to an application and will
eventually be dropped.

Looking at packets 1 and 2:

* Packet 1 is destined for TCP port 80, matches the rule at position 1, and is
accepted.

* For packet 2, the packet fragment with the header contains a destination of
TCPÂ port 80, matches the rule at position 1, and is accepted.

* The non-header packet fragment of packet number 2 does not contain a header,
does not match the rule at position number 1, and continues to the rule at
position number 2.

* This non-header packet fragment does not contain a TCP/UDP header, therefore
does not match the rule at position number 2, is not dropped, and continues to
the rule at position number 3.

* The rule at position number 3 accepts all packets, so this packet fragment is
accepted.

This change allows non-header fragments to get past both the rules at positions
1 and 2, and exit the chain with an ACCEPT. With this change, the firewall now
lets all non-header fragments through, but you decided that the level of risk is
acceptable and are just trying to fix the broken HTTP flows. This is not a
problem, as an unwanted nonheader fragment will be discarded if the
corresponding header fragment is never received.
