= Static NAT

This section demonstrates how MidoNet uses static NAT to implement floating IP
addresses.

MidoNet implements floating IP addresses in a two-stage process:

. Bring traffic to a floating IP address (that is, bring traffic from an
external network to a tenant router).

. Perform network address translation from the external network's public IP
address to a private IP address and in the reverse direction.

* At least one VM connected to the bridge

* A floating IP address assigned to at least one VM.
