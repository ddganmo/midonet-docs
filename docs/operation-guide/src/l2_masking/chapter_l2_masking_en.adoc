[[l2_address_masking]]
= L2 address masking

You can use L2 address masking to filter out specific L2 frames, such as
multicast frames. This allows you to add a single rule with a specific mask,
which reduces the number of rules needed.

Below a couple of important facts about L2 address masking in MidoNet:

* OpenStack security group rules don't match L2 fields, so this feature is
provided for customers who directly access/use MidoNet's API and CLI.

* Old rules that do not include values for the hw-dst-mask attribute in the CLI
should be interpreted as having the values for this field/attribute set to the
default: ffff.ffff.ffff

See xref:rule_chains[] for information about rule chains, including information
about the hw-src-mask and hw-dst-mask attributes used to implement this feature.
