= Monitoring with Zabbix

This section describes how to integrate Zabbix with MidoNet for monitoring
events.

Zabbix is a popular monitoring tool that provides a way for system
administrators to monitor their networks. See https://www.zabbix.com/ and
navigate to Documentation for details about Zabbix usage.

*Basic Steps for Using Zabbix*

In Zabbix, you can monitor log files stored on the filesystem. You need to run
the Zabbix agent for each node, and set up a log monitoring configuration with
the file location, update interval, etc.Â 

* Run Zabbix on each Gateway and Compute host.

* Configure log file monitoring; this includes the following tasks:

** Verify agent parameters.

** Configure items (an item is a piece of metric data you want to retrieve from
a host).

** Specify the path to the log file to monitor, along with the regular
expressions to match.

** Configure triggers to notify users when specified events occur.

for more details.
