= MidoNet monitoring

MidoNet is composed of various services; each service exposes a variety of
metrics that can be fetched from typical monitoring services, such as Zabbixâ„¢,
Munin, and so on.

This chapter describes the main available metrics for each service, as well as a
procedure to configure a basic monitoring infrastructure based on Munin, based
on scripts provided with the MidoNet deployment package.
