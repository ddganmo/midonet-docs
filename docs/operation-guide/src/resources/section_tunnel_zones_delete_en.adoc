= Deleting tunnel zones

Use this procedure to delete a tunnel zone.

. Enter the `list tunnel-zone` command to list the tunnel zones. For example:
+
[source]
midonet> list tunnel-zone
tzone tzone0 name new-tz type vxlan
tzone tzone1 name vxlan type vxlan

. Enter the `delete tunnel-zone tz-alias` command to delete the desired tunnel
zone. For example:
+
[source]
midonet> delete tunnel-zone tzone0
+
Specify the dynamically assigned number of the alias for the tunnel zone to
delete; in the above example, the assigned number is 0 (tzone0).

. (Optional) Enter the command to list the tunnel zones to confirm the deletion:
+
[source]
midonet> list tunnel-zone
tzone tzone1 name vxlan type vxlan
