= Admitting resources to MidoNet

When started, the MidoNet Agent (midolman) automatically connects to the
ZooKeeper database and registers itself as an available host. You need to admit
that host into a tunnel zone so the host can communicate within the tunnel zone
to other hosts.

You can think of this as registering the host. When you admit a host, you select
the physical interface the host will use for communication with other hosts.
This interface must be connected to the underlay network. After you select the
interface, you bind it to the tunnel zone. This allows the host to establish
tunnels with all the other hosts in the tunnel zone via the selected interface.
