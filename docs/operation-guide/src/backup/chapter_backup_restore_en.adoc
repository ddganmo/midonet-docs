* OpenStack Databases (Neutron, Keystone)
* ZooKeeper data

== Configuration Files

On all nodes, backup the following configuration files.

RHEL:

[source]
----
/etc/cassandra/conf/cassandra.yaml

== Restore

Before restoring the data, ensure that all affected services are being stopped.

Additionally to the OpenStack services, the following MidoNet related services
have to be stopped:

RHEL:

[source]
----
# systemctl stop cassandra.servive
# systemctl stop midolman.servive
# systemctl stop midonet-cluster.servive
# systemctl stop zookeeper.servive
----

Ubuntu:

[source]
----
# service cassandra stop
# service midolman stop
# service midonet-cluster stop
# service zookeeper stop
