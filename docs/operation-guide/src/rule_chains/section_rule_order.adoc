[[rule_order]]
= Rule order

Rules are stored as an ordered list in a rule chain and are evaluated in the
listed order.

A specific rule is not evaluated in the event any preceding rules (or rules in
chains that may have been 'jumped to') matched and resulted in an action (e.g.
REJECT, ACCEPT) that terminates the processing of the packet in the chain.

The position of a rule in a rule chain is not an attribute of the rule. In the
REST API, the rule-creation method specifies an integer position for the new
rule in the rule chain. But that position is only meaningful relative to the
rules already existing in the chain and is only used to modify the current rule
list.

[NOTE]
Please read xref:packet_flow_within_rule_chain[] for an overview of rule-chain
processing.
