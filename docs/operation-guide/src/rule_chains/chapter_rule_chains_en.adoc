= Rule chains

The routing logic for a MidoNet virtual router includes the traversal of rule
chains that may modify, record state, or reject a packet.

A newly created router has two chains: one named 'pre-routing' and the other
named 'post-routing'. Below are a few important facts about rule chains:

* You can put chains not only on routers, but also on bridges and ports, too.

* Pre-routing chains have access to the ingress port ID, while post-routing
chains have access to both the ingress and egress port. During post-routing, the
router routes the packet and both the ingress port and the egress router port
are known.
